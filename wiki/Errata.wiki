In Figure 3.26, delete eight boxes.

*Page 216*

Near the middle of the page, correct the spelling of "translation" from "tranlation" in the sentence
"This translation of ...".

*Page 270*

In the caption for Figure 6.35, change "Figure 2.25" to "Figure 2.28".

*Page 282*

In the Assembly Language listing, change "2" to "4" and "0" to "2" as follows:
{{{
retVal:  .EQUATE 4           ;returned value #2d
a:       .EQUATE 2           ;formal parameter #2d
}}}

*Page 294*

In Figure 6.39(b), change "0060" to "0063" in the box for `retAddr`.

*Page 301*

In the Assembly Language listing, change "2d" to "2h" in three places as follows:
{{{
a:       .BLOCK  2           ;global variable #2h
b:       .BLOCK  2           ;global variable #2h
c:       .BLOCK  2           ;global variable #2h
}}}

In the caption for Figure 6.49, change "Figure 6.25" to "Problem 6.23".

*Page 479*

In the caption for Figure 9.28(b), change "mirros" to "mirrors".

In Figure 10.13, change " a + b dot c' " to "a + b' dot c " as the expression is in the caption.

*Page 592*

In Exercise 9, change "... as in Figure 11.30" to "... as in Figure 11.31". Add a phrase at the end of the third sentence to read " When Clear is 1, both the master state, Q2, and the slave state, Q, should be forced to 0 assuming that the clock input remains at 0."

*Page 614*

In the caption for Figure 12.14, add "memory" to read "The pinout diagram of the Pep/8 memory chip."

*Page A25, Appendix*

In the solution for Exercise 9, change the entire paragraph to read as follows:

"9 (a) Hint:  To force the master and slave to 0 assuming that the clock remains at 0, consider the possibility of adding an extra input to some of the NOR gates."
